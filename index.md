# BIO

Hi, My name is Son Pham and Iâ€™m a Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of South Florida, Tampa. As a highly motivated research trainee in Biostatistics and Data Science, my interests involve solving interdisciplinary biomedical and health science problems in public health industry using quantitative skills including statistics, data analytics, and machine learning. I am seeking for internship experience with three following discipline 1) Biostatistical Methods, 2) Statistics , 3) Health Data Science, in order to prepare me for top graduate programs in Biostatistics.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four


### Programming Language

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```
### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
